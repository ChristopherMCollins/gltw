	 * <p>The VertexBatch is a class that manages a set of buffer object containing

	 * the VertexBatch, one must copy the vertex data into the buffers by using one
	 * or more of the copy*Data functions.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>An example of the use of this class for drawing a triangle follows.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><code>
	 *    // Initialization (need only be done once)<br />
	 *    GLfloat verts[] = { -0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f, 0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f };<br />

	 *    <br />
	 *    // Within the draw function<br />
	 *    myBatch.draw();<br />
	 *    </code></p>

	 *   least once before drawing.</p>
